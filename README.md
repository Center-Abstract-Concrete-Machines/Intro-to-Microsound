| “Beneath the level of the note lies the realm of microsound, of sound particles. Microsonic particles remained invisible for centuries. Recent technological advances let us probe and explore the beauties of this formerly unseen world. Microsonic techniques dissolve the rigid bricks of musical architecture – the notes – into a more fluid and supple medium. Sound may coalesce, evaporate, or mutate into other sounds.” - Curtis Roads, Microsound (2001)

What does a 41000th of a second sound like?

Intro  to Microsound is a 4-session course introducing students to the Gen~  programming environment inside of MaxMSP. Graham Wakefield, a student of  Curtis Roads, created Gen~ to allow for the visually patching and  coding of audio at the level of an individual sample of digital signal  (i.e. the programs we will write will run more than 41000 times per  second).

In the course of 4 weeks, we will go from constructing  sound one single sample at a time to diffusing dynamic and long-form  sonic textures via microsound techniques such as granular and pulsar  synthesis. We will also discuss multichannel and hardware applications  (e.g. mc.gen~ and OopsyDaisy).

This  course serves as a technical introduction to Gen~ couched in the  environment’s conceptual strengths: microsound and processual  composition. We welcome both experienced sound programmers as well as  brave newcomers; both will walk about with new techniques and new ways  of thinking about working with sound.

Students will download a  custom code library developed to speed up iteration. It will include  examples that you'll be invited to study ahead of class. It will also  include some custom operators (you may know this as abstractions or  objects in Max/MSP or functions in programming languages).

During  class, we’ll rebuild through the examples, with opportunity to ask  questions about presented materials. Sometimes there may also be ~30  mins of unstructured work time, when you can ask the instructors  questions particular to your own explorations.
